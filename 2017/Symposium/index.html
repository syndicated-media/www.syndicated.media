          <h2>Spring 2017 Symposium</h2>
          <h4>May 11 at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/DQG85u8FfjD2">Berkman Klein Center For Internet &amp; Society</a></h4>
          <p>In May 2017 Berkman Klein Center will host and facilitate a podcast symposium in association with syndicated.media - an open working group of technologists focused on advancing open standards and best practices that support podcasting as a robust and growing medium. </p>
          <p>The one-day event at <a href="http://cyber.harvard.edu/">Berkman Klein</a> will focus on the evolution of podcasting with the goal of furthering cooperation and recommendations on standards, enhancements, extensions and other methods to support the growth of podcasting as an open and inclusive medium. There will be a pre-event dinner on the 10th for attendees.</p>
          <p>The symposium will be followed by a separate two-day “audio for good” hackathon, co-hosted by PRX and RadioPublic, in partnership with Berkman Klein and additional partners and sponsors to be named.</p>
          <p>We anticipate 50-60 participants in the symposium, and 150-200 in “audio for good”.</p>
          <p>In addition to hosting the syndicated.media working group agenda, Berkman will offer a broader frame of academic inquiry, such as exploring the history of open media protocols, legal analysis of rights issues of openly syndicated content, advisory recommendations on governance for open standards communities of interest.</p>
          <hr>
          <p>In the last two years podcasting has hit a tipping point in mainstream adoption. Over 67 million people listen to podcasts each month in the US, growing at over 25% per year.  A rapidly expanding industry and ecosystem is taking shape across content creation, publishing, distribution, discovery, and monetization. Apple remains the largest platform for podcasting, with major players like Google, Spotify, Audible and Pandora starting to integrate podcasts into their services. Independent creators, content networks, and podcast apps and a variety of service providers are starting to arrive. Public radio remains a foundational force, dominating the charts with shows from NPR, PRX, WNYC, This American Life and others.</p>
          <p>There is also a growing number of industry conferences, events, and associations starting to address myriad needs in the podcasting space including Podcast Movement, the Podcast Summit, Third Coast International Audio Festival, in addition to an uptick in live events for podcast fans in venues across the country.</p>
          <p>Growth in content, audience, and revenue is intensifying the competitive landscape, with resulting pressure to address problems related to metrics, metadata, advertising, audience insight, and more.</p>
          <p>These are unique and exciting challenges in developing technologies that power an open standard like podcasting. From the basic and ubiquitous formats that have come to be relied on, to recent advances like dynamic audio serving and advanced metrics and analytics, there is a wide array of topics that must be addressed.</p>
          <p>Syndicated.media is a community-driven working group with a mission to ensure that podcasting grows to meet the needs of listeners, creators, producers, publishers, advertisers, and developers, without sacrificing the groundwork that has been established to make it an open and inclusive medium.</p>
          <p>The goal of the working group is to develop clear and comprehensive standards and best practices. The group now includes over 40 representatives from a growing number of podcast industry stakeholders, including international participants, and intends to incrementally release updates to existing standards and recommendations for new proposals.</p>
